            <h2>Meet Sweta - Your Yoga Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Sweta, a certified yoga teacher with over a decade of experience guiding students on their yoga
                journey. My love for yoga began during my college years and quickly grew into a lifelong passion. To
                deepen my practice, I completed my 200-hour yoga teacher training at Health Yoga Life in Boston, where I
                cultivated a strong foundation in yoga philosophy, meditation, and mindful movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I've had the privilege of teaching at Massachusetts General Hospital, local studios, and
                community centers, helping students of all levels find balance and strength through yoga. My expertise
                extends to restorative and Yin yoga, and my teaching style blends gentle yet challenging sequences with
                a focus on proper alignment and breath awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the mat, I cherish spending time with my family, exploring nature through hiking, and diving into
                a good book. I believe that yoga is a lifelong journey of learning and self-discovery, and I am
                committed to growing as both a practitioner and a teacher. I look forward to sharing this beautiful
                practice with you!
